    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This gazpacho pasta salad is based on everybody's favorite cold summer soup, gazpacho. It's wonderfully fresh,
        vibrant,
        and deliciously different.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Gazpacho Dressing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large English cucumber, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup roughly chopped red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sliced green onions, white and light green parts only</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds fresh, ripe tomatoes, cored and quartered</li>
        <li>5 basil leaves, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Salad</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound large elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1/4 cup diced red bell pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced red onion</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel just over half the cucumber, and set aside. Finely dice remaining unpeeled cucumber and reserve in the
            refrigerator.</li>
        <li>For gazpacho dressing, cut peeled cucumber into large chunks and add to the jar of a large blender; add in
            red bell
            pepper, jalapeno, green onion, garlic, tomatoes, basil, salt, black pepper, sugar, wine vinegar, and olive
            oil. Blend
            until smooth; strain into a large bowl. You should have 7 to 8 cups dressing.</li>
        <li>For salad, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook macaroni until not quite tender with a bite,
            about 6
            minutes, or about 15 to 30 seconds less than package directions. Drain very well and let cool slightly,
            stirring
            occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir macaroni into gazpacho dressing until very well coated. Wrap and refrigerate for at least 5 hours or up
            to
            overnight.</li>
        <li>The next day, stir salad again, and then stir in reserved diced cucumber, red bell pepper, and red onion.
            Season with
            salt and freshly ground black pepper and serve.</li>
    </ol>
